Classifiers:
- Added alarm function to Live Classifier, with trigger settings for species labels and certainty scores.
- Sampling option added where smaller classes have their training data entries duplicated until each class matches the size of the largest class.
- Exporting full results in Test Classifier now includes confusion matrices specific to subsets and accuracy labels regardless of validation method.
- Fixed a bug in the Live Classifier where settings couldn't be saved due to an issue with data blocks.
- Fixed a bug where the Live Classifier's overlay graphics wouldn't show up, again due to an issue with data blocks.
- Removed some annoying print statements.
WMNT:
- Added option to change the buffer length between the detection and the edge of the spectrogram when pressing the scroll button.
- Replaced "clear selection" button with button that selects all contours within the spectrogram's current viewing range.
- Changed time zone conversion options in WMNT â€” instead of drop-down boxes, there are just check boxes for selecting whether or not to convert from your system's local time to UTC.
- Buttons slightly re-arranged in the GUI.
- Removed some annoying print statements.
