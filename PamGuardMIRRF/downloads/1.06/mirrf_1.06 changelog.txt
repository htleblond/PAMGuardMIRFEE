1.06a (June 28th, 2024)
Classifiers:
- Added alarm function to Live Classifier, with trigger settings for species labels and certainty scores.
- Sampling option added where smaller classes have their training data entries duplicated until each class matches the size of the largest class.
- Exporting full results in Test Classifier now includes confusion matrices specific to subsets and accuracy labels regardless of validation method.
- Fixed a bug in the Live Classifier where settings couldn't be saved due to an issue with data blocks.
- Fixed a bug where the Live Classifier's overlay graphics wouldn't show up, again due to an issue with data blocks.
- Removed some annoying print statements.
WMNT:
- Added option to change the buffer length between the detection and the edge of the spectrogram when pressing the scroll button.
- Replaced "clear selection" button with button that selects all contours within the spectrogram's current viewing range.
- Changed time zone conversion options in WMNT â€” instead of drop-down boxes, there are just check boxes for selecting whether or not to convert from your system's local time to UTC.
- Buttons slightly re-arranged in the GUI.
- Removed some annoying print statements.

1.06b (July 5th, 2024)
WMNT:
- Species and call type label lists can now be exported to and imported from .txt files.
- Added button that brings up dialog listing species and call type counts.
- Replaced "Select all" button with button that selects the first detection in the table that hasn't been labelled yet.
- Added toggle-able hotkeys for certain buttons and for streamlined labelling of selected detections.
- "Select all in spectrogram view" button now scrolls to the selected detections in the table when pressed.
- Condensed settings dialog into tabs.
- Buttons slightly re-arranged in the GUI again.

1.06c (August 30th, 2024)
Feature Extractor:
- Added "formant frequency ratio" as a feature.
- Tentatively fixed bug where unfinished clusters are pushed to the block too early in live streaming setups, resulting in multiple clusters with the same ID being sent to the Live Classifier.
- Changed means through which the FEProcess signals FEThreadManager that vectors can be pushed to the block.
- Added threading options to a new "experimental" tab in the settings dialog.
Classifiers:
- Feature usefulness analysis now checks for correlation between features and displays the most correlated feature for each respective feature and its absolute correlation score.
- Fixed significant time zone issues in the Live Classifier.
Training Set Builder:
- Fixed bug where editing a subset would delete the loaded feature list.
WMNT:
- Swapped positions of "Undo" and "Scroll" buttons.

1.06d (October 4th, 2024)
Training Set Builder:
- Added settings for skipping over detections that are too low or high in frequency or too short or long in duration.
Classifiers:
- (Apparently) fixed synchronization bug that caused the classifiers to skip over entries, causing them to get stuck in a perpetual backlog.
WMNT and Live Classifier:
- Predictions from the Live Classifier can now exported to the WMNT for automatic annotation.
Feature Extractor:
- Improved the time complexity of the algorithm that decides which detections should be processed when the data input is an external .wmnt or .mirrfts file.
