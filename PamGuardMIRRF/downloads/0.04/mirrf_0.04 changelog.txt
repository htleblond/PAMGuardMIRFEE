0.04a (bug fixes, July 14th, 2023)
- Fixed casting exception caused by attempting to cast to an array of Strings in WMNTPanel.
- csvEntriesList now clears itself in getParams() in FESettingsDialog.
	- NOTE that this caused three times as many detections to be sent to Python, which repeatedly crashed the interpreter.
- Fixed bug where invalid spectral contrast settings could be selected in FEFeatureDialog
- Reduced maximum number of FE threads to 2 - somehow this improves it.
