0.04 (July 10th, 2023)
- Print statement toggles added to FE, LC and TC.
- LCProcess.PamStop() while-loops re-instated.
- Attribution and comments added to classes and functions.

0.04a (bug fixes, July 14th, 2023)
- Fixed casting exception caused by attempting to cast to an array of Strings in WMNTPanel.
- csvEntriesList now clears itself in getParams() in FESettingsDialog.
- Fixed bug where invalid spectral contrast settings could be selected in FEFeatureDialog
- Reduced maximum number of FE threads to 2 - somehow this improves it.

0.04b (additions and bug fixes, July 14th-18th, 2023)
- Added limit to number of clips that can be processed at once to FEPythonThreadManager (overloading this repeatedly caused the interpreter to crash).
- Fixed the Training Set Builder not the reading the new .wmnt header correctly.
- Apparently fixed printBestFeatureOrder() in LCPythonScript (was causing the BufferedReader to freeze - still haven't figured out why).
- Fixed Training Set Builder's loader not taking Feature Extractor params into account.
- Removed move up/down buttons from Training Set Builder as they were arguably pointless due to sorting by column value.
- Fixed delete and edit buttons deleting/editing the wrong rows when the table is sorted by column value.
- Fixed bug in the Training Set Builder where the feature list was accidentally cleared when a subset was edited.
- Added dialog in Training Set Builder for selecting class labels when saving a training set (as opposed to automatically saving all of them).

0.04c (additions and bug fixes, July 19th-20th, 2023)
- Training Set Builder will now list unmatched features in the error message if a selected .mirrffe file's features don't match those in the table.
- Fixed bug in Test Classifier crashed the Python interpreter when only trying to test one subset.
- Tentatively fixed "best features" button in Live Classifier.
- Re-enabled the components in the Feature Extractor's settings dialog in Viewer mode.
- Re-enabled the full settings dialog for the Live Classifier in Viewer mode (although it still does not activate the Python interpreter).
