Holly LeBlond

1.03a (August 11th, 2023)
- SQLite compatibility added to the WMNT:
	- Option added to execute table updates without having commit on the spot, allowing later commits via File > Save Data.
	- (Bug fix) Statements and ResultsSets in WMNTSQLLogging now close, which they didn't do before.
- WMNT's settings dialog now opens when adding the module, in order to select a WMD instance and change time zones easier.

1.03b (August 14th, 2023)
- WMNT now recursively looks for binary files in subfolders.
- Added warning message to WMNT in case no binary files are found in the selected folder.

1.03c (August 15th, 2023)
- Removed annoying print statement from WMNT's binary data loading function.
- The WMNT's binary data loading dialog now appears while searching for files, and displays how many have been counted.

1.03d (September 4th, 2023)
- Audio batch creator in Training Set Builder:
	- Can now read data from external .wmnt or .mirrfts files.
	- Can ignore certain labels like the Feature extractor can.
	- Daylight Savings Time option added.
	
1.03e (September 19th, 2023)
- Feature Extractor taking data input from .wmnt files now ignores contours with a high frequency above the Nyquist frequency.
- Classifier best-features dialog:
	- Bug fix: F-values were previously calculated incorrectly when retrieving best-features scores in LCPythonScript.
	- p-values now added to table in dialog.
- "Ignored" classifier results are now no longer added to the confusion matrix and are instead added to the accuracy matrix if they exceed the minimum detection limit.
- Classifier "full results" export:
	- Bug fix: Feature Extractor settings previously did not get written.
	- Individual entries are now sorted by ID string, as opposed to the current order in the table.
	
1.03f (September 22nd, 2023)
- .mirrffe and .wmnt file merging in the Training Set Builder had an O(n^2) list search, which has been replaced with a hash map. (Rookie mistake, I know!)
