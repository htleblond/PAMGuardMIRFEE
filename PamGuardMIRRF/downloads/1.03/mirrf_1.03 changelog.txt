1.03a (August 11th, 2023)
- SQLite compatibility added to the WMNT:
	- Option added to execute table updates without having commit on the spot, allowing later commits via File > Save Data.
	- (Bug fix) Statements and ResultsSets in WMNTSQLLogging now close, which they didn't do before.
- WMNT's settings dialog now opens when adding the module, in order to select a WMD instance and change time zones easier.

1.03b (August 14th, 2023)
- WMNT now recursively looks for binary files in subfolders.
- Added warning message to WMNT in case no binary files are found in the selected folder.
