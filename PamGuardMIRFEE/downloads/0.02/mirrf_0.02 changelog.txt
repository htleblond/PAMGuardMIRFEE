(May include stuff added in 0.01, I lost track)

- Created new file extensions:
	- .wmnt (WMNT export)
	- .mirrffe (Feature Extractor output)
	- .mirrfts (training set)
- Added FE audio settings info to .mirrffe and .mirrfts files
- Fixed loading dialogs in classifiers
- Made it possible to initiate pre-loaded training sets in both LC and TC
- Fixed TC start/stop button (though the code for it is a mess)
